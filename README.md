# E155 Lab 6
This repository includes MCU code that interfaces with a DS1722 temperature sensor via SPI, decodes real-time ambient temperature value, and serves a web page to control an LED and display temperature readings at various resolutions. The webpage is accessed via USART (Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) communication through the ESP8266(ESP32) Web Server.
